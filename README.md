# Python Shutdown Timer

This Python code sets up a shutdown timer for your computer. After a specified delay period, the code will initiate a system shutdown.
Prerequisites

    Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Usage

    Open a text editor and create a new file.
    Copy and paste the code into the file.
    Save the file with a .py extension, e.g., shutdown_timer.py.
    Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
    Run the script by typing python shutdown_timer.py and pressing Enter.

Customization

You can customize the delay period before shutdown by modifying the delay variable. The value is in seconds, so you can set it to the desired number of seconds. For example, if you want to set a delay of 1 hour (3600 seconds), change the line:

python

delay = 3600

Notes

    Make sure you have saved any unsaved work before running this script, as the shutdown will happen without further warning.
    This code uses the os.system() command to initiate the shutdown process. Depending on your operating system, the command might vary. The current code is designed for Windows and uses the shutdown command with /s for shutdown and /t for the delay in seconds. If you are using a different operating system, you'll need to modify the os.system() command accordingly.

Disclaimer: Use this code responsibly. Performing unexpected system shutdowns can lead to data loss or other undesirable consequences.

Feel free to modify and adapt this code according to your specific requirements. Happy coding!
